This repository contains the slides and source for the Openshift 101 talk/workshop.

The slides do work as standalone presentation and contain speaker notes on when each exercise should be started.

Each exercise directory contains a README.md which explains the point and commands needed to complete the exercise.

PR's are always welcomed
